# DUDE X Generated Project

This project was generated by [DUDE X Builder](https://github.com/mcelestino-conversion/dude-x) - an AI-powered code generation system that creates complete, production-ready web applications.

## 🚀 What is DUDE X?

DUDE X uses a **planning-first generation approach** (similar to Replit/Cursor) to create comprehensive web applications:

1. **Planning Phase**: Analyzes requirements and creates a detailed implementation plan with tasks, dependencies, and architecture decisions
2. **Generation Phase**: Executes the plan to generate all necessary files in the correct order

## 📁 Project Structure

This project follows modern web development best practices:

```
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
├── components/             # React components
├── lib/                    # Utility functions and helpers
├── public/                 # Static assets
├── dudex/                  # DUDE X metadata
│   └── canon.json          # Canonical build specification (source of truth)
├── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
├── next.config.js          # Next.js configuration
└── README.md               # This file
```

## 📋 Source of Truth

The **`/dudex/canon.json`** file contains the canonical build specification that was used to generate this project. This file is:

- **Immutable**: Represents the exact requirements used for generation
- **Versioned**: Each regeneration creates a new version
- **Traceable**: Links back to the original build intent
